                <p>
                    Hilsa (or ilish) curry is the national dish of Bangladesh, made from the Hilsa fish, and is one of the most popular traditional Bangladeshi dishes. The Hilsa fish is marinated in turmeric and chili paste, before slowly frying on a low heat and serving
                    with a mustard gravy and rice. The result is a combination of sweet and sour flavours with an incredible spicy kick. Aside from being cheap, Hilsa curry is filling, flavoursome, easy to make and widely available due to the amount of
                    Hilsa fish in the region, especially during rainy season. The sheer abundance of the Hilsa fish is why Hilsa Curry is the national dish of Bangladesh. In Bangladesh it is common to eat every part of the Hilsa fish including the head
                    and the eggs, nothing is wasted and each part even has its own unique delicacies. You can find fish egg dishes or fish head curries that are widely revered throughout the region.

                <p>
                    Biryani, whilst not unique to Bangladesh, is a spicy rice dish made with meat or fish, rice, potatoes and spices. Hugely popular throughout the Indian subcontinent, Bangladeshi biryani is often considered the best in the world. In the Bengali region,
                    popular meats include mutton, goat, chicken and beef, but there is such a wide variety of biryani dishes available that you can try. A true traditional biryani involves different types of cooking and preparation, as marinated meat
                    is layered with rice, potatoes and spices, the dish is jam packed with flavour. You will often find biryani served at special occasions or celebrations such as weddings, but it is also eaten as a regular meal throughout the weak, such
                    is its popularity.

                <p>
                    Changri malai curry is the most famous Bangladesh curry dish based on coconut milk, and is revered throughout the region, including India. Chingri Malai (or Chingri Macher Malaikari as it is sometimes known), is a delicious creamy, satisfying seafood
                    curry that is prepared by cooking prawns or shrimp in a coconut milk sauce with aromatic spices and served with basmati rice. Coconut milk is a very common ingredient in Bangladeshi cuisine, and this Changri Malai curry is a perfect
                    example of that. The word Malai suggests the dish was actually brought to the region by Malaysian sailors docking at the Bay of Bengal many years ago, and the use of coconut in curries gives credence to this theory since it is popular
                    in South-East Asian cuisine. Bangladeshi cooking is famed for its use of seafood and fish in curries, so Chingri malai is definitely a dish to try if youâ€™re ever in the region.
